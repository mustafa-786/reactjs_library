          A library management system is software that is designed to manage all
          the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the
          database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along
          with their due dates. This system completely automates all your
          library’s activities. The best way to maintain, organize, and handle
          countless books systematically is to implement a library management
          system software. A library management system is used to maintain
          library records. It tracks the records of the number of books in the
          library, how many books are issued, or how many books have been
          returned or renewed or late fine charges, etc. You can find books in
          an instant, issue/reissue books quickly, and manage all the data
          efficiently and orderly using this system. The purpose of a library
          management system is to provide instant and accurate data regarding
          any type of book, thereby saving a lot of time and effort.
